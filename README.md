# cleanstreet_5800
Academic team project (CIS 5800 EMWA, Baruch College, Spring 2025) designing a responsive, user-friendly platform for NYC drivers. Users search by address/street to view current cleaning days, see an interactive map (Google Maps API), bookmark spots, and receive timely SMS/push notifications—pulling live data from NYC Open Data and 311 API.
Key highlights: Reduces unnecessary violations through better accessibility, promotes compliance with DSNY goals, incorporates ethical considerations (ADA compliance, equitable access for low-income users), and aligns with smart-city trends for scalable urban solutions.
My contributions: Authored the Executive Summary and Project Introduction (including DSNY overview, SWOT analysis, mission alignment, and strategic fit).
Planned tech: React + Tailwind (frontend), Python/Node.js (backend), MySQL database, free NYC APIs.
Full planning doc: Included in repo. Great showcase of Agile PM, stakeholder analysis, risk/comms planning, public-service impact, and API integration thinking for real-world civic problems.
