Real-time NYC Street Cleaning Schedule & Parking Reminder Web App

**Helping NYC residents avoid parking tickets with easy access to street cleaning information.**

This is a team academic project from **CIS 5800 EMWA** (Baruch College, Spring 2025).  
CleanStreetNYC is a planned responsive web application that lets users:

- Search by street name, address, or intersection to view current cleaning days and rules
- See an interactive map showing cleaning zones (powered by Google Maps API)
- Bookmark favorite locations for quick access
- Receive timely SMS or push notifications before cleaning days

All data is pulled from **NYC Open Data** and the **311 API** for accuracy and real-time updates.

### Why It Matters
- Reduces unnecessary parking violations caused by unclear or hard-to-find schedules
- Improves compliance with NYC Department of Sanitation (DSNY) goals
- Promotes equitable access (ADA-compliant design, helpful for low-income residents)
- Aligns with smart-city trends for better urban information delivery

### Planned Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Python / Node.js (or Firebase)  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **APIs & Data**: NYC Open Data, 311 API, Google Maps API  
- **Tools**: GitHub (version control), Trello (task tracking)

### My Contributions
- Wrote the **Executive Summary**
